Deep Learning
Ὄ01/2024-06/2024 EY
•Leveraged data augmentation techniques such as
rotation, ﬂipping, and scaling to increase the diversity
of training data and improve model generalization.
•Utilized YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8)
object detection model for accurate and real-time
detection of building in images.
•The evaluation metrics used to assess the model’s
performance such as mAP (mean Average Precision),
IoU (Intersection over Union).
•Develop a Streamlit web application for detecting
images containing four type of buildings .

Machine Learning | Sequential time series data
Ὄ01/2024- 05/2024 EY
•The data is split into training and testing sets, and the
Random Forest Regressor is trained to learn patterns
between features and the target variable.
•After training, evaluation metrics include MAE, MSE,
and RMSE.

Identiﬁcation for Supply Chain Documents
LLM |Gemini-1.5-ﬂash |text-embedding-004
Ὄ08/2024- 11/2024 EY
•Create an object for generating vector embeddings of text chunks using pre-train sen-
tence tranformer model like text-embedding-004 .
•Utilize the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library to eﬃciently search for embed-
dings of multimedia documents that exhibit similarity to one another.
•Perform Nearest Neighbourhood Search to retrieve top k relevant chunk of the user
input.
•UseTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to vectorize the bot’s re-
sponse sentence.
•Apply cosine similarity to compare the vectorized bot’s response with potential source
sentences and ﬁnd the most similar source.
